# Copy this to Colab and run:

# 1. Uninstall potentially conflicting packages first.

# 2. Install core dependencies with specific versions.
# We start with huggingface_hub and tokenizers as they are often foundational.
# Adjust versions based on your specific needs, but this is a good starting point.
!pip install --no-cache-dir huggingface_hub==0.22.2 tokenizers==0.19.1

# 3. Install transformers. This version should be compatible with the hub and tokenizers.
!pip install --no-cache-dir transformers==4.39.3

# 4. Install accelerate. This should be compatible with transformers.
!pip install --no-cache-dir accelerate==0.29.3

# 5. Install peft. This should be compatible with accelerate and transformers.
!pip install --no-cache-dir peft==0.10.0

# 6. Install any other necessary libraries (e.g., datasets, torch, etc.)
# !pip install --no-cache-dir datasets
